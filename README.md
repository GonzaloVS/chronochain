# chronochain
Cryptographically verifiable timestamps with RFC 3161 support, local signatures, and future support for other implementations.

chronochain is a Rust library designed for secure, auditable, and verifiable logging systems.

It provides:

Generation of cryptographically secure timestamps.

Verification against public RFC 3161-compliant TSAs.

Local signature capabilities for authenticity and integrity.

Chaining of timestamped entries via a Merkle or blockchain-style structure.

Ideal for applications requiring tamper-proof logging, compliance auditing, or verifiable deployments.
